3. Amazing Grace

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now am found
Was blind, but now I see
T'was grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

Through many dangers, toils, and snares
I have already come
T'was grace that brought me safe this far
And grace will lead me home

The Lord has promised good to me,
His word my hope secures;
He will my shield and portion be,
As long as life endures

Yes, when this flesh and heart shall fail,
And mortal life shall cease,
I shall possess, within the veil,
A life of joy and peace
When we've been there ten thousand years,
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we first begun

In your arms of love

Holding me still
Holding me near
In your arms of love

Here in the love of Christ I stand

In Christ alone, who took on flesh
Fullness of God in helpless babe
This Gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones He came to save
Till on that cross as Jesus died
The wrath of God was satisfied
For every sin on Him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I live

There in the ground His body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain
Then bursting forth in glorious day
Up from the grave he rose again
And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ

No guilt in life, no fear in death
This is the power of Christ in me
From life's first cry to final breath
Jesus commands my destiny
No power of hell, no scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from His hand
Till He returns or calls me homeHere
in the power of Christ I'll stand

A great High Priest whose name is love
Who ever lives and pleads for me

My name is graven on his hands
My name is written on his heart
I know that while in heaven he stands
No tongue can bid me thence depart,
No tongue can bid me thence depart.

When Satan tempts me to despair
And tells me of the guilt within,
Upward I look and see Him there
Who made an end of all my sin.

Because a sinless savior died,
My sinful soul is counted free;
For God, the Just, is satisfied
To look on Him and pardon me,
To look on Him and pardon me.

Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Praise the One,
Risen Son of God!

Behold Him there, the risen Lamb,
My perfect, spotless righteousness,
The great unchangeable I AM,
The king of glory and of grace!

One in Himself, I cannot die
My soul is purchased by his blood,
My life is hid with Christ on high,
With Christ, my Savior and my God,
With Christ, my Savior and my God.
Hallelujah! Hallelujah I Praise the One,
Risen Son of God!

And hath shed his own blood for my soul.

Chorus

My sin, o, the joy of this glorious thought!
My sin, not in part, but the whole, 
Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more!
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!

The clouds be rolled back as a scroll;
The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,
Even so, it is well with my soul!

How deep the Father's love for us
How vast beyond all measure
That He should give his only Son
To make a wretch his treasure

How great the pain of searing loss,
The Father turned His face away
As wounds which mar the Chosen One
Bring many sons to glory

Behold the Man upon the cross
My sin upon his shoulders
Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice
Call out among the scoffers

It was my sin that held him there
Until it was accomplished
His dying breath has brought me life
I know that it is finished

I will not boast in anything
No gifts , no power, no wisdom,
But I will boast in Jesus Christ,
His death and resurrection

Why should I gain from his reward?
I cannot give an answer.
But this I know with all my heart:
His wounds have paid my ransom.

Now I surrender

You in me dwelling, and I with you one.

Riches I need not, nor man's empty praise.
You're my inheritance now and always.
You and you only are first in my heart.
Lord, King of heaven,my treasure you are.

Be Thou my shield and my sword for the fight
Be Thou my dignity, be Thou my might
You're my soul's shelter and You're my high tower

Echoes of mercy, whispers oflove.

Watching and waiting, looking above,
Filled with His goodness, lost in His love.

69. By Faith
By faith we see the hand of God
In the light of creation's grand design
In the lives of those who prove His faith-ful-ness
Who walk by faith and not by sight

By faith our fathers roamed the Earth
With the power of His promise in their hearts
Of a holy city built by God's own hand
A place where peace and justice reign

Chorus:
We will stand as children of the promise
We will fix our eyes on Him our soul's reward
Till the race is finished and the work is done
We'II walk by faith and not by sight

By faith the prophets saw a day,
When the longed-for Messiah would appear
with the power to break the chains of sin & death,
And rise triumphant from the grave

By faith the church was called to go,
In the power of the spirit to the lost
To deliver captives and to preach good news
In every corner of the earth

Chorus

By faith this mountain shall be moved,
And the power of the gospel shall prevail
For we know in Christ all things are possible,
For all who call upon His name

70. Come Now Fount
Come now fount of every blessing teach my heart to know your grace
And your mercy never ceasing calls for songs of loudest praise.
Jesus sought me while a stranger all alone and without God.
Lord you saved me from sin's danger when you paid with your own blood.

O to grace how great a debtor daily I'm constrained to be,
Let your goodness like a fetter bind my wandering heart to Thee.
Prone to wander, Lord I feel it prone to leave the God I love,
Here's my heart Lord take and seal it, seal it for that home above.

Help me know I'm undeserving of the kindness that you've shown,
With your mercy so unswerving such a love's from you alone.
Help me show this love to others when they too like me can't earn,
All the favor that you cover me with at my every turn.

71. The God On the Mountain

Life is easy when you're up on the mountain
And you've got peace of mind like you've never known.
But then things change and you're down in the valley.
Don't lose faith for you're never alone.

Chorus:
For the God on the mountain is still God in the valley.
When things go wrong, He'll make it right.
And the God of the good times
is still God in the bad times.
The God of the day is still God in the night.

You talk of faith when you're up on the mountain.
Oh but the talk comes easy when life's at its best.
But it's down in the valley of trials and temptation
That's when faith is really put to the test.

Chorus 2x

72. Here Is Love Vast As the Ocean

Here is love, vast as the ocean,
Loving kindness as the flood,
When the Prince of Life, our Ransom,
Shed for us His precious blood.Who His love
will not remember?
Who can cease to sing His praise?
He can never be forgotten,
Throughout Heav'n's eternal days.

On the mount of crucifixion,
Fountains opened deep and wide;
Through the floodgates of God's mercy
Flowed a vast and gracious tide.
Grace and love, like mighty rivers,
Poured incessant from above,
And Heav'n's peace and perfect justice
Kissed a guilty world in love.

Let me all Thy love accepting,
Love Thee, ever all my days;
Let me seek Thy kingdom only
And my life be to Thy praise;
Thou alone shalt be my glory,
Nothing in the world I see.
Thou hast cleansed and sanctified me,
Thou Thyself hast set me free.

In Thy truth Thou dost direct me
By Thy Spirit through Thy Word;
And Thy grace my need is meeting,
As I trust in Thee, my Lord.
Of Thy fullness Thou art pouring
Thy great love and power on me,
Wrthout measure, full and boundless,
Drawing out my heart to Thee.

73. I'll Fly Away

Some glad morning when this life is o'er, I'll fly away;
To a home on God's celestial shore, I'll fly away.

Chorus:
I'll fly away to glory, I'll fly away; (in the morning)
When I die, Hallelujah, by and by, I'll fly away.

When the shadows of this life have gone I'll fly away
Like a bird from prison bars has flown, I'll fly away

Chorus

Oh how glad and happy when we meet, I'll fly away,
No more cold iron shackles on my feet, I'll fly away.

Chorus 

Just a few more weary days and then, I'll fly away;
To a land where joy shall never end, I'll fly away.

Chorus

74. Nothing But the Blood

What can wash away my sin?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
What can make me whole again?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

Chorus:
Oh! precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow;
No other fount I know,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

For my pardon, this I see,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
For my cleansing this my plea,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

Chorus

Nothing can for sin atone,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
Naught of good that I have done,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

Chorus
This is all my hope and peace,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
This is all my righteousness,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

Chorus

75. Old Rugged Cross

On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,
The emblem of suffering and shame;
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain.

Chorus:
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

O that old rugged cross, so despised by the world
Has a wondrous attraction for me;
For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above
To bear it to dark Calvary.

Chorus

In that old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine,
A wondrous beauty I see,
For 'twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died,
To pardon and sanctify me.

Chorus

To the old rugged cross I will ever be true;
Its shame and reproach gladly bear;
Then He'll call me some day to my home far away,
Where His glory forever I'll share.

Chorus

76. There Is a Fountain

There is a fountain filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins;
and sinners plunged beneath that flood lose all their guilty stains.
Lose all their guilty stains,
lose all their guilty stains;
and sinners plunged beneath that flood lose all their guilty stains.

The dying thief rejoiced to see that fountain in his day;
and there may I, though vile as he, wash all my sins away.
Wash all my sins away,
wash all my sins away;
and there may I, though vile as he, wash all my sins away.

Dear dying Lamb, thy precious blood shall never lose its power
till all the ransomed church of God be saved, to sin no more.
Be saved, to sin no more,
be saved, to sin no more;
till all the ransomed church of God be saved, to sin no more.

E'er since, by faith, I saw the stream thy flowing wounds supply,
redeeming love has been my theme, and shall be till I die.
And shall be till I die,
and shall be till I die;
redeeming love has been my theme, and shall be till I die.

Then in a nobler, sweeter song, I'll sing thy power to save,
when this poor lisping, stammering tongue lies silent in the grave.
Lies silent in the grave,
lies silent in the grave;
when this poor lisping, stammering tongue hes silent m the grave.

80. All My Tears

When I go, don't cry for me
In my Father's arms I'll be
The wounds this world left on my soul
Will all be healed and I'll be whole.

Sun and moon will be replaced
With the light of Jesus' face
And I will not be ashamed
For my Savior knows my name.

Chorus:
It don't matter where you bury me,
I'll be home and I'll be free.
It don't matter where I lay,
All my tears be washed away.

Gold and silver blind the eye
Temporary riches lie
Come and eat from heaven's store,
Come and drink, and thirst no more

So, weep not for me my friend,
When my time below does end
For my life belongs to Him.
Who will raise the dead again.

83. How He Loves

He is jealous for me,
Loves like a hurricane, I am a tree, 
Bending beneath the weight of His wind and mercy. 

When all of a sudden,
I am unaware of these afflictions eclipsed by glory,
And I realize just how beautiful You are,
And how great Your affections are for me.

And oh, how He loves us, oh,
Oh, how He loves us,
How He loves us all

He is jealous for me,
Loves like a hurricane, I am a tree,
Bending beneath the weight of His wind and mercy.
When all of a sudden,

And I realize just how beautiful You are, 
And how great Your affections are for me. 

He loves us, oh
Oh how He loves us,
Oh how He loves us, 
Oh how He loves.

We are His portion and He is our prize, 
Drawn to redemption by the grace in His eyes,
If grace is an ocean, we're all sinking.
So Heaven meets earth like an unforeseen kiss,
And my heart turns violently inside of my chest,
I don't have time to maintain these regrets,
When I think about, the way...

PRE CHORUS:
And oh, how He loves us oh
Oh how He loves us,
How He loves us all...

Yeah, He loves us,
Oh how He loves us,
Oh how He loves us,
Oh how He loves.

And a light unto my path.
Thy word is a lamp unto my feet
And a light unto my path.

And think I've lost my way.

Nothing will I fear
As long as you are near;
Please be near me to the end.

Refrain

I will not forget
Your love for me and yet,
My heart forever is wandering.
Jesus by my guide, 
And hold me to your side,
And I will love yeu to the end.

85. Grace Alone

Verse 1
I was an orphan, lost at the fall,
running away when I'd hear you call

But Father you worked your will

I bad no righteousness of my own,
I bad no right to draw near your throne

But Father you loved me still

Chorus 1
And in love before you laid the world's foundation,
You predestined to adopt me as your own
You have raised me up so high above my station
I'm a child of God by grace and grace alone

Verse 2
You left your home to seek out the lost,
You knew the great and terrible cost

But Jesus your face was set

I worked my fingers down to the bone,
But nothing I did could ever atone

But Jesus, you paid my debt

Chorus 2
By your blood I have redemption and salvation
Lord you died that I might reap what you have sown
And you rose that I might be a new creation
I am born again by grace and grace alone

Verse 3
I was in darkness all of my life
I never knew the day from the night

But Spirit, you made me see

I swore I knew the way on my own
Head full of rocks and heart made of stone

But Spirit, you moved in me

Chorus 3
And at your touch my sleeping spirit was awakened
On my darkened heart the light of Christ has shone
Called into a kingdom that cannot be shaken
Heaven's citizen by grace and grace alone

Chorus 4
So I'll stand in faith by grace and grace alone
I will run the race by grace and grace alone
I will slay my sin by grace and grace alone
I will reach the end by grace and grace alone

86. Tree of Life

A tree was cut, two timbers bare
And laid to form a cross.
Two nails were forged, crude, black steel,
All meant to kill the King, but God meant it all for 
Good, all for good, all for good

Chorus
He poured out His own life,
He poured out His own blood,
He poured out all His love

Two thieves did die, on crosses near
They shared in His dark hour
But I was slain on the exact same cross 
My death was done with His 
Then He and I were 
raised to life, raised to life, raised 

Chorus

By His wounds I am healed.
Pierced for me, despised
His death brought me life, darkness to light
An orphan to an heir, a son 
Now I have peace with
God, peace with God, peace with God

Chorus x2

That tree was cut for me 
That tree was raised for me 
That tree is where I died

Of how we long to worship You

The riches of Your love
You have shown us Your heart
For those in need

To the cries of the poor
You called us
To be your hands and feet

88. O, For a 1,000 Tongues to Sing

O for a thousand tongues to sing 
my great Redeemer's praise,
The glories of my God and King, 
the triumphs of His grace. 

Jesus, the name that calms our fears, 
that bids our sorrows cease;
It's music in the sinner's ears 
His life, and love, and peace.

He breaks the power of cancelled sin,
He sets the prisoner free;
His blood can make the foulest clean;
His blood did that for me.

My gracious Master and my God, 
assist me to proclaim,
To spread through all the earth abroad,
salvation in Your name.

Glory to God and praise and love 
be now and ever given
By saints below and saints above, 
the Church in earth and heaven

89. Take Me In

Take me past the outer courts
Into the Holy Place 
Past the brazen alter
Lord I want to see your face

Pass me by the crowds of people
And the Priests who sing your praise
I hunger and thirst for your righteousness
But it's only found in one place

Chorus:
Take me into the holy of holies
Take me in by the blood of the lamb
Take me into the holy of holies
Take the coal, touch my lips, here I am
