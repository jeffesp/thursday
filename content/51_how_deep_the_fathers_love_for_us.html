<p>How deep the Father's love for us
How vast beyond all measure
That He should give his only Son
To make a wretch his treasure</p>

<p>How great the pain of searing loss,
The Father turned His face away
As wounds which mar the Chosen One
Bring many sons to glory</p>

<p>Behold the Man upon the cross
My sin upon his shoulders
Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice
Call out among the scoffers</p>

<p>It was my sin that held him there
Until it was accomplished
His dying breath has brought me life
I know that it is finished</p>

<p>I will not boast in anything
No gifts , no power, no wisdom,
But I will boast in Jesus Christ,
His death and resurrection</p>

<p>Why should I gain from his reward?
I cannot give an answer.
But this I know with all my heart:
His wounds have paid my ransom. </p>
