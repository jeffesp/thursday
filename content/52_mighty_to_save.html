<p>Everyone needs compassion
A love that's never failing
Let mercy fall on me
Everyone needs forgiveness
The kindness of a Savior
The hope of nations</p>

<p><strong>Chorus:</strong>
Savior
He can move mountains
My God is mighty to save
He is mighty to save
Forever
Author of Salvation
He rose and conquered the grave
Jesus conquered the grave</p>

<p>So take me as you find me
All my fears and failures
Fill my life again
I give my life to follow
Everything I believe in
Now I surrender</p>

<p><strong>Bridge:</strong> (2x)
Shine your light and
Let the whole world see
We're singing
For the glory
Of the Risen King
Jesus</p>
