<p>In the stillness of this hour
I worship You my Lord crying,
"Holy is the Lord on high."
In the quiet of my heart
I sing this song of praise crying,
"Holy is the Lord on high."</p>

<p>And for all of my days
I will bow down before You
Giving glory and honor to your name.
And for all ofmy life
I will worship and adore You crying,
"Holy is the Lord on high."
