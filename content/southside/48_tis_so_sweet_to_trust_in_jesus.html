<p>'Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus
And to take him at his word
Just to rest upon his promise
and to know, "Thus saith the Lord."</p>

<p><strong>Chorus:</strong>
Jesus, Jesus, how I trust him!
How I've proved him o'er and o'er!
Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!
O, for grace to trust him more!</p>

<p>O, how sweet to trust in Jesus,
Just to trust his cleansing bloodAnd
in simple faith to plunge me
'Neath the healing, cleansing flood!</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>

<p>Yes, 'tis sweet to trust in Jesus
Just from sin and self to cease
Just from Jesus simply taking
Life and rest, and joy and peace.</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>

<p>I'm so glad I learned to trust Thee
Precious Jesus, Savior, friend
And I know that Thou art with me
Wilt be with me to the end</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>
