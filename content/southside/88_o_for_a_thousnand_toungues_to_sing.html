<p>O for a thousand tongues to sing 
my great Redeemer's praise,
The glories of my God and King, 
the triumphs of His grace. 
</p>

<p>Jesus, the name that calms our fears, 
that bids our sorrows cease;
It's music in the sinner's ears 
His life, and love, and peace.
</p>

<p>He breaks the power of cancelled sin,
He sets the prisoner free;
His blood can make the foulest clean;
His blood did that for me.
</p>

<p>My gracious Master and my God, 
assist me to proclaim,
To spread through all the earth abroad,
salvation in Your name.
</p>

<p>Glory to God and praise and love 
be now and ever given
By saints below and saints above, 
the Church in earth and heaven
</p>
