<p>Your love, O Lord reaches to the heavens
Your faithfulness stretches to the sky
Your righteousness is like the mighty mountain
And Your justice flows like the ocean's tides
And I will lift my voice to worship you, my King .
And I will find my strength in the shadow of your wmgs
<em>(repeat 2x)</em></p>
