<p>I have a Maker, He formed my heart
Before even time began, My life was in His hands</p>

<p><strong>Chorus:</strong>
He knows my name, He knows my every thought
He sees each tear that falls, & He hears me when I call</p>

<p>I have a Father, He calls me His own
He'll never leave me, No matter where I go
<em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>
