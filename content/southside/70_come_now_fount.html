<p>Come now fount of every blessing teach my heart to know your grace
And your mercy never ceasing calls for songs of loudest praise.
Jesus sought me while a stranger all alone and without God.
Lord you saved me from sin's danger when you paid with your own blood.
</p>

<p>O to grace how great a debtor daily I'm constrained to be,
Let your goodness like a fetter bind my wandering heart to Thee.
Prone to wander, Lord I feel it prone to leave the God I love,
Here's my heart Lord take and seal it, seal it for that home above.
</p>

<p>Help me know I'm undeserving of the kindness that you've shown,
With your mercy so unswerving such a love's from you alone.
Help me show this love to others when they too like me can't earn,
All the favor that you cover me with at my every turn.
</p>
