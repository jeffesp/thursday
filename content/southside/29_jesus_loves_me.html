<p> Jesus loves me this I know,
For the Bible tells me so
Little ones to Him belong
They are weak but he is strong</p>

<p><strong>Chorus:</strong>
Alleluia, allelu. Alleluia, alleluia
Alleluia, allelu. Alleluia, alleluia </p>

<p>Jesus Loves me He who died
Heaven's gates are open wide
He will wash away my sin,
Let His little child come in </p>
