<p>Lord of all creation
Of water earth and sky
Heavens are your tabernacle
Glory to the Lord on high</p>

<p><strong>Chorus:</strong>
God of wonders beyond our galaxy
You are holy, holy
The universe declares your majesty
You are holy, holy</p>

<p><strong>Bridge:</strong>
Lord of heaven and earth <em>(echo)</em>
Lord of heaven and earth</p>

<p>Early in the morning
I will celebrate the light
When I stumble in the darkness
I will call your name by night
<em>(repeat Chorus and Bridge)</em></p>

<p>Hallelujah, to the Lord of heaven and earth <em>(repeat 3x)</em>
<em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>
