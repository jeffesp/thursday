<p>Lord you are more precious than silver,
Lord you are more costly than gold
Lord you are more beautiful than diamonds
And nothing I desire compares with You</p>

<p>Lord Your love is deeper than the oceans
Lord Your love is wider than the seas
Lord Your love encompasses the nations
And nothing I desire compares with You </p>

<p>Lord Your grace saves all who will believe You
Lord Your grace is undeserved and free
Lord Your grace gives power in my weakness
And nothing I desire compares with You </p>
