<p>I cast all my cares upon You
I lay all of my burdens down at Your feet
And any time I don't know just what to do
I will cast all my cares upon You
I cast all my cares upon You
I lay all of my burdens down at Your feet
And any time I don't know just what to do
I will cast all my cares upon You
I will cast all my cares upon You</p>
