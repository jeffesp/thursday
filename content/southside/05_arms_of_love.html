<p>I sing a simple song of love
To my Savior, to my Jesus
I'm grateful for the things you've done
My loving Savior, my precious Jesus</p>

<p>My heart is glad that you've called me your own
There's no place I'd rather be</p>

<p>In your arms of love
In your arms of love
Holding me still
Holding me near
In your arms of love</p>
