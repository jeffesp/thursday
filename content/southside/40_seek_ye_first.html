<p>Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and His righteousness,
And all these things shall be added unto you, Allelu, Alleluia
Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word,
That proceeds from the mouth of God, Allelu, Alleluia
Ask and it shall be added unto you, seek and you shall find
Knock and the door shall be opened unto you, Allelu, Alleluia</p>
