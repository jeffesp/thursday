<p>He is jealous for me,
Loves like a hurricane, I am a tree, 
Bending beneath the weight of His wind and mercy. 
</p>

<p>
When all of a sudden,
I am unaware of these afflictions eclipsed by glory,
And I realize just how beautiful You are,
And how great Your affections are for me.
</p>

<p>And oh, how He loves us, oh,
Oh, how He loves us,
How He loves us all
</p>

<p>He is jealous for me,
Loves like a hurricane, I am a tree,
Bending beneath the weight of His wind and mercy.
When all of a sudden,
I am unaware of these afflictions eclipsed by glory,
And I realize just how beautiful You are, 
And how great Your affections are for me. 
</p>

<p>He loves us, oh
Oh how He loves us,
Oh how He loves us, 
Oh how He loves.
</p>

<p>We are His portion and He is our prize, 
Drawn to redemption by the grace in His eyes,
If grace is an ocean, we're all sinking.
So Heaven meets earth like an unforeseen kiss,
And my heart turns violently inside of my chest,
I don't have time to maintain these regrets,
When I think about, the way...
</p>

<p><strong>Pre-Chorus:</strong>
And oh, how He loves us oh
Oh how He loves us,
How He loves us all...</p>

<p><strong>Chorus:</strong>
Yeah, He loves us,
Oh how He loves us,
Oh how He loves us,
Oh how He loves.</p>
