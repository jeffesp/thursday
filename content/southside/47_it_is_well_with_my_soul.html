<p>When peace, like a river, attendeth my way,
When sorrows, like sea billows, roll
Whateve my lot, thou hast taught me to say, 
"It is well, it is well with my soul."</p>

<p><strong>Chorus:</strong>
It is well (it is well)
With my soul (with my soul)
It is well, it is well, with my soul.</p>

<p>Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come, 
Let this blest assurance control:
That Christ has regarded my helpless estate,
And hath shed his own blood for my soul.</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>

<p>My sin, o, the joy of this glorious thought!
My sin, not in part, but the whole, 
Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more!
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>

<p>And, Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight,
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll;
The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,
Even so, it is well with my soul!</p>
<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>
