<p>In heavenly armor we'll enter the land,
The battle belongs to the Lord.
No weapon that's mshioned against us will stand,
The battle belongs to the Lord!
</p>

<p><strong>Chorus:</strong>
We sing glory, honor,
power, and strength to the Lord.
We sing glory, honor,
Power, and strength to the Lord.</p>

<p>When the power of darkness comes in like a flood,
The battle belongs to the Lord!
He's raised up a standard, the power of His blood,
The battle belongs to the Lord!
</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>

<p>When your enemy presses in hard do not fear,
The battle belongs to the Lord!
Take courage, my friend, your redemption is near,
The battle belongs to the Lord!
</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>
