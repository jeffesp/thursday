<p>You have shown us,
oh God what is good
You have shown us, 
oh Lord what you require</p>

<p><strong>Pre-Chorus:</strong>
You have heard all our songs
Of how we long to worship You
Yet you told us the offering You desire</p>

<p><strong>Chorus:</strong>
To do justly - To love mercy
To walk humbly - Wrth You, God (2x)</p>

<p>You have shown us
The riches of Your love
You have shown us Your heart
For those in need</p>

<p><em>(repeat Pre-Chorus)</em></p>

<p>Lord, You're opening our ears
To the cries of the poor
You called us
To be your hands and feet</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>
