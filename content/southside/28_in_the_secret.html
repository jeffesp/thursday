<p>In the secret, in the quiet place
In the stillness you are there
In the secret, in the quiet hour I wait
Only for you
'Cause I want to know you more
</p>

<p><strong>Chorus:</strong>
I want to know you
I want to hear your voice
I want to know you more
I want to trust you
1 want to se.ek your face
I want to know you more </p>

<p>I am reaching for the highest goal
That I might receive the prize
Pressing onward, pushing every hindrance aside
Out of my way
'Cause I want to know you more
<em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>
