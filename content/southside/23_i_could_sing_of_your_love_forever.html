<p>Over the mountains and the sea, Your river runs with love for me
And I will open up my heart and let the healer set me free
I'm happy to be in the truth and I will daily lift my bands
For I will always sing of when Your love came down </p>

<p>I could sing of Your love forever
I could sing of Your love forever
I could sing of Your love forever
I could sing of Your love forever </p>

<p>Oh, I feel like dancing, it's foolishness I know
But when the world has seen the light
They will dance with joy like we're dancing now </p>
