<p>The nails in Your hands
The nail in Your feet,
They tell me how much You love me
The thorns on Your brow,
They tell me how,
You bore so much shame to love me.</p>

<p>And when the heavens pass away,
All Your scars will still remain,
And forever they will say,
How much You love me
And I want to say</p>

<p>Forever my love,
Forever my heart
Forever my life, it's yours</p>
