<p>What can wash away my sin?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
What can make me whole again?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
</p>

<p><strong>Chorus:</strong>
Oh! precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow;
No other fount I know,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.</p>

<p>For my pardon, this I see,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
For my cleansing this my plea,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>

<p>Nothing can for sin atone,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
Naught of good that I have done,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>

<p>This is all my hope and peace,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
This is all my righteousness,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.  </p>
