<p>Lord, prepare me to be a sanctuary
Pure and holy, tried and true
With thanksgiving, I'll be a living
Sanctuary for You</p>

<p>It is you, Lord who came to save
The heart and soul of every man
It is you Lord who knows my weakness,
Who gives me strength, with thine own hand</p>

<p>Lead Me on Lord from temptation,
Purify me from within.
Fill my heart with Your
holy spirit,
Take away all my sin</p>
