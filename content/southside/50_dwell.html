<p>Dwell in the midst of us
Come and dwell in this place
Dwell in the midst of us
Come and have Your way</p>

<p>Dwell in the midst of us
Wipe all the tears from our faces
Dwell in the midst of us
You can have Your way</p>

<p>Not our will, but Yours be done
Come and change us
Not our will, but Yours be done
Come sustain us</p>
