<p>Take me past the outer courts
Into the Holy Place 
Past the brazen alter
Lord I want to see your face
</p>

<p>Pass me by the crowds of people
And the Priests who sing your praise
I hunger and thirst for your righteousness
But it's only found in one place
</p>

<p><strong>Chorus:</strong>
Take me into the holy of holies
Take me in by the blood of the lamb
Take me into the holy of holies
Take the coal, touch my lips, here I am</p>
