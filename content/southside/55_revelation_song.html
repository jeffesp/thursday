<p>Worthy is the Lamb that was slain. Holy, holy, is He.
Sing a new song to Him who sits on Heaven's Mercy Seat.
<em>(repeat)</em></p>

<p><strong>Chorus:</strong>
Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord God Almighty
Who was, and is, and is to come
With all creations I sing: Praise to the King of Kings!
You are my everything, and I will adore you!</p>

<p>Clothed in rainbows of living color,
Flashes of lightning, rolls of thunder;
Blessing and honor, strength and glory and power be
To You, the Only Wise King</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>

<p>Filled with wonder, awestruck wonder
At the mention of Your Name
Jesus, Your Name is Power, Breath, and Living Water
Such a marvelous mystery!</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus and Verse 1)</em></p>
