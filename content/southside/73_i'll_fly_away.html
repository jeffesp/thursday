<p>Some glad morning when this life is o'er, I'll fly away;
To a home on God's celestial shore, I'll fly away.
</p>

<p><strong>Chorus:</strong>
I'll fly away to glory, I'll fly away; (in the morning)
When I die, Hallelujah, by and by, I'll fly away.</p>

<p>When the shadows of this life have gone I'll fly away
Like a bird from prison bars has flown, I'll fly away
</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>

<p>Oh how glad and happy when we meet, I'll fly away,
No more cold iron shackles on my feet, I'll fly away.</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>

<p>Just a few more weary days and then, I'll fly away;
To a land where joy shall never end, I'll fly away.  </p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>
