<p><strong>Chorus:</strong>
Thy word is a lamp unto my feet
And a light unto my path.
Thy word is a lamp unto my feet
And a light unto my path.</p>

<p>When I feel afraid,
And think I've lost my way.
Still, you're there right beside me.
Nothing will I fear
As long as you are near;
Please be near me to the end.
</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>

<p>I will not forget
Your love for me and yet,
My heart forever is wandering.
Jesus by my guide, 
And hold me to your side,
And I will love yeu to the end.
</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>
