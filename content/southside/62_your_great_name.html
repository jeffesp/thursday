<p>Lost are saved, find their way, at the sound
Of Your Great Name
All condemned feel no shame, at the sound
Of Your Great Name
Every fear has no place at the sound
Of Your Great Name
The enemy, he has to leave, at the sound 
Of Your Great Name</p>

<p><strong>Chorus:</strong>
Jesus, worthy is the Lamb that slain
for us, Son of God and Man
You are high and lifted up I And all the world
will praise Your Great Name!</p>

<p>All the weak find their strength at the sound
Of Your Great Name
Hungry souls receive grace at the sound
Of Your Great Name
The fatherless, they find their rest at the sound
Of Your Great Name
Sick are healed, and the dead are raised at the sound
Of Your Great Name</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>

<p><strong>Bridge:</strong>
My Healer, Redeemer, Lord Almighty
My savior, Defender, You are my King! </p>
