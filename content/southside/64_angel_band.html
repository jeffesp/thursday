<p>My latest sun is sinking fast, My race is nearly run
My strongest trials now are past, My triumph is begun</p>

<p><strong>Chorus:</strong>
Oh, come, angel band. Come and around me, stand
Oh, bear me away on your snow white wings
To my immortal home
Oh, bear me away on your snow white wings
To my immortal home</p>

<p>Oh, bear my longing heart to him, Who bled and died for me
Whose blood now cleanses from all sin, And brings me victory</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>

<p>I've almost gained my heavenly Home, My spirit loudly sings
The Holy Ones behold they come, I hear the noise of wings</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>

<p>I know I'm near the holy ranks, of friends and kindred dear,
I've brushed the dew on Jordan's banks, the crossing must be near</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>
