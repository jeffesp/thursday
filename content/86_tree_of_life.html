<p>A tree was cut, two timbers bare
And laid to form a cross.
Two nails were forged, crude, black steel,
All meant to kill the King, but God meant it all for 
Good, all for good, all for good
</p>

<p><strong>Chorus:</strong>
He poured out His own life,
He poured out His own blood,
He poured out all His love</p>

<p>Two thieves did die, on crosses near
They shared in His dark hour
But I was slain on the exact same cross 
My death was done with His 
Then He and I were 
raised to life, raised to life, raised 
</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>

<p>By His wounds I am healed.
Pierced for me, despised
His death brought me life, darkness to light
An orphan to an heir, a son 
Now I have peace with
God, peace with God, peace with God
</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus x2)</em></p>

<p>That tree was cut for me 
That tree was raised for me 
That tree is where I died
</p>
