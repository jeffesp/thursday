<p>It is good to give thanks to the Lord
And to sing praises to Your name
To declare your loving-kindness
In the morning</p>

<p>It is good to give thanks to the Lord
And to sing praises to Your name
To declare your loving-kindness
In the evening</p>

<p>And Your faithfulness
It keeps me through the night
And Your love that never ends
It is my rock</p>
