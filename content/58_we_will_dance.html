<p>Sing a song of celebration
Lift up a shout of praise
For the Bridegroom will come
The glorious One
And, oh, we will look on His face
We'll go to a much better place</p>

<p>Dance with all your might
Lift up your hands and clap for joy
The time's drawing near when He will appear
And, oh, we will stand by His side
A strong, pure, spotless bride </p>

<p><strong>Chorus:</strong>
We will dance on the streets that are golden
The glorious bride and the great Son of Man
From every tongue and tribe and nation
Will join in the song ofthe Lamb</p>
