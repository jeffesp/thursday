<p> You are my strength when I am weak
You are the treasure that I seek
You are my all in all
Seeking You as a precious jewel
Lord, to give up, I'd be a fool
You are my all in all </p>
<p><strong>Chorus:</strong>
Jesus, Lamb of God, worthy is Your name
Jesus, Lamb of God, worthy is Your name </p>
<p>Taking my sin, my cross, my shame
Rising again, I bless Your name
You are my all in all
When I fall down, You pick me up
When I am dry, You fill my cup
You are my all in all </p>
<p>(repeat Chorus) </p>
