<p>I lift my eyes up, unto the moun.tains
Where does my help come from
My help comes from you, maker of heaven
Creator of the earth </p>

<p><strong>Chorus:</strong>
Oh how I need you Lord
You are my only hope
You're my only prayer
So I will wait for you
To come and rescue me
Come and give me life </p>
