<p>I was an orphan, lost at the fall,
running away when I'd hear you call
</p>

<p>But Father you worked your will
</p>

<p>I bad no righteousness of my own,
I bad no right to draw near your throne
</p>

<p>But Father you loved me still
</p>

<p>And in love before you laid the world's foundation,
You predestined to adopt me as your own
You have raised me up so high above my station
I'm a child of God by grace and grace alone
</p>

<p>You left your home to seek out the lost,
You knew the great and terrible cost
</p>

<p>But Jesus your face was set
</p>

<p>I worked my fingers down to the bone,
But nothing I did could ever atone
</p>

<p>But Jesus, you paid my debt
</p>

<p>By your blood I have redemption and salvation
Lord you died that I might reap what you have sown
And you rose that I might be a new creation
I am born again by grace and grace alone
</p>

<p>I was in darkness all of my life
I never knew the day from the night
</p>

<p>But Spirit, you made me see
</p>

<p>I swore I knew the way on my own
Head full of rocks and heart made of stone
</p>

<p>But Spirit, you moved in me
</p>

<p>And at your touch my sleeping spirit was awakened
On my darkened heart the light of Christ has shone
Called into a kingdom that cannot be shaken
Heaven's citizen by grace and grace alone
</p>

<p>So I'll stand in faith by grace and grace alone
I will run the race by grace and grace alone
I will slay my sin by grace and grace alone
I will reach the end by grace and grace alone
</p>
