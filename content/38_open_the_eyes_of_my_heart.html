<p>Open the eyes of my heart, Lord
Open the eyes of my heart
I want to see You, I want to see You <em>(repeat)</em></p>

<p>To see You high and lifted up
Shining in the light of your glory
Pour out your power and love
As we sing holy, holy, holy.</p>

<p>Holy, holy, holy
Holy, holy, holy
Holy, holy, holy
I want to see You. </p>
