<p>Come to Me all you who are weary and burdened
And I will give you rest (repeat)
</p>

<p>Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me
For I am gentle and humble in heart
</p>

<p>Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me
You will find rest for your soul
You will find rest for your soul
</p>

<p><strong>Outro</strong>
For My yoke is easy
And My burden is light
For My yoke is easy
And My burden is light
