<p>Light of the world, You stepped down into darkness
Opened my eyes, let me see
Beauty that made this heart adore You
Hope of a life spent with You</p>

<p> <em> Chorus: </em>
Here I am to worship, Here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that, You're my God
You're altogether lovely, Altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me </p>

<p>
King of all days, Oh so highly exalted
Glorious in heaven above
Humbly You came to the earth You created
All for love's sake, became poor
<em> (repeat Chorus) </em> </p>

<p>I'll never know how much it co,st,
To see my sin upon that cross
<em> (repeat) </em> </p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>
