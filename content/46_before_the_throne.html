<p>Before the throne of God above
I have a strong and perfect plea
A great High Priest whose name is love
Who ever lives and pleads for me</p>

<p>My name is graven on his hands
My name is written on his heart
I know that while in heaven he stands
No tongue can bid me thence depart,
No tongue can bid me thence depart.</p>

<p>When Satan tempts me to despair
And tells me of the guilt within,
Upward I look and see Him there
Who made an end of all my sin. </p>

<p>Because a sinless savior died,
My sinful soul is counted free;
For God, the Just, is satisfied
To look on Him and pardon me,
To look on Him and pardon me.</p>

<p>Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Praise the One,
Risen Son of God!</p>

<p>Behold Him there, the risen Lamb,
My perfect, spotless righteousness,
The great unchangeable I AM,
The king of glory and of grace!</p>

<p>One in Himself, I cannot die
My soul is purchased by his blood,
My life is hid with Christ on high,
With Christ, my Savior and my God,
With Christ, my Savior and my God.
Hallelujah! Hallelujah I Praise the One,
Risen Son of God!</p>
