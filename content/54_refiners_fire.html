<p>Purify my heart:
let me be as gold and precious silver.
Purify my heart:
let me be as gold, pure gold.</p>

<p><strong>Chorus:</strong>
Refiner's fire;
My heart's one desire
is to be holy;
Set apart for You, Lord.
I choose to be holy;
Set apart for You, my Master,
ready to do Your will.</p>

<p>Purify my heart,
Cleanse me from within
And make me holy.
Purify my heart,
Cleanse me from my sin, deep within.</p>
