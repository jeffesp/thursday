<p>I'm forgiven, because you were forsaken
I'm accepted, you were condemned
I'm alive and well, you're spirit is within me
Because you died and rose again <em>(repeat)</em></p>

<p><strong>Chorus</strong>:
Amazing love, how can it be
that you my king would die for me
Amazing love, I know it's true
It's my joy to honor you <em>(repeat)</em>
In all I do I honor you</p>

<p>You are my king,
You are my king
Jesus, You are my king, 
Jesus, You are my king</p>
