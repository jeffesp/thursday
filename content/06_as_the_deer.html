<p>As the deer panteth for the water
So my soul longeth after You
You alone are my heart's desire
And I long to worship You</p>

<p><strong>Chorus:</strong>
You alone are my strength, my shield
To You alone will my spirit yield
You alone are my heart's desire
And I long to worship You</p>

<p>You're my friend, and You are my brother
Even though You are a King
I love You more than any other
So much more than anything</p>
<p>(repeat Chorus)</p>
