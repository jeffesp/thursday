<p>Jesus loves the little children;
All the children of the world--
Red and yellow, black, and white
They are precious in His sight.
Jesus loves the little children of the world.</p>

<p>Jesus died for all the children&hellip;</p>

<p>Jesus rose for all the children&hellip;</p>

<p>Jesus lives for all the children&hellip;</p>
