<p>Come, Thou fount of ev'ry blessing,
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;
Streams of mercy, never ceasing,
Call for songs of loudest praise.
Teach me some melodious sonnet
Sung by flaming tongues above;  (pause)
Praise His name—I'm fixed upon it—
Name of God's redeeming love.  (pause)</p>

<p>Hitherto Thy love has blest me;
Thou hast brought me to this place;
And I know Thy hand will bring me
Safely home by Thy good grace.
Jesus sought me when a stranger,
Wand'ring from the fold of God; (pause)
He, to rescue me from danger,
Bought me with His precious blood.  (pause)</p>

<p>O' to grace how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to be!
Let Thy goodness, like a fetter,
Bind my wand'ring heart to Thee;
Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,
Prone to leave the God I love; (pause)
Here's my heart, O' take and seal it;
Seal it for Thy courts above.</p>
