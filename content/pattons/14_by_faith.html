<p>By faith we see the hand of God 
In the light of creation's grand design 
In the lives of those who prove His faithfulness 
Who walk by faith and not by sight</p>

<p>By faith our fathers roamed the earth 
With the pow'r of His promise in their hearts 
Of a holy city built by God's own hand 
A place where peace and justice reign</p>

<p class="chorus"><strong>Chorus</strong>
We will stand as children of the promise 
We will fix our eyes on Him our soul's reward 
Till the race is finished and the work is done 
We'll walk by faith and not by sight</p> 

<p>By faith the prophets saw a day 
When the longed-for Messiah would appear 
With the pow'r to break the chains of sin and death 
And rise triumphant from the grave</p>

<p>By faith the church was called to go 
In the pow'r of the Spirit to the lost 
To deliver captives and to preach good news 
In ev'ry corner of the earth</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>

<p>By faith the mountain shall be moved 
And the pow'r of the gospel shall prevail 
For we know in Christ all things are possible 
For all who call upon His name</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>
