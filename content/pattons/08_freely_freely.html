<p>God forgave my sins in Jesus' name;
I've been born again in Jesus' name.
And in Jesus' name I come to you
To share His love as He told me to.
</p>

<p class="chorus"><strong>Chorus:</strong>
He said, 
"Freely, freely you have received
Freely, freely give.
Go in my name and because you believe,
Others will know that I live."
</p>

<p>All power is given in Jesus' name;
In earth and heaven in Jesus' name.
And in Jesus' name I come to you
To share His power as He told me to.
</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>
