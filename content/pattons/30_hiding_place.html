<p>You are my hiding place.
You always fill my heart
with songs of deliverance.
Whenever I am afraid I will trust in You.</p>

<p>I will trust in You.
Let the weak say I am strong
in the strength of the Lord</p>

<p>(gals) I will trust in You
	(guys) You are my hiding place
(gals) I will trust in You
	(guys) You always fill my heart
(gals) Let the weak say
(all) I am strong in the strength of my Lord.</p>
