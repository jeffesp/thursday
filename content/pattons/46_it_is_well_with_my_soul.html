<p>When peace like a river attendeth my way,
when sorrows like sea billows roll,
whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say,
"It is well, it is well with my soul."</p>

<p class="chorus"><strong>Chorus:</strong>
It is well (it is well) 
with my soul (with my soul),
It is well, it is well with my soul.</p>

<p>Tho' Satan should buffet, tho' trials should come,
let this blessed assurance control,
that Christ hath regarded my helpless estate,
and hath shed His own blood for my soul.</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>

<p>My sin—O the bliss of this glorious tho't—
My sin—not in part, but the whole—
is nailed to His cross, and I bear it no more!
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>

<p>And, Lord, haste the day when the faith shall be sight,
the clouds be rolled back as a scroll,
the trump shall re-sound and the Lord shall descend,
even so—it is well with my soul.</p>
