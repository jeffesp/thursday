<p>Just as I am, without one plea
But that Your blood was shed for me
And that You biddâ€™st me come to Thee,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.</p>

<p>Just as I am though tossed about
With many a conflict, many a doubt,
Fightings and fears within, without,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.</p>

<p>Just as I am, You will receive,
Will welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;
Because Your promise I believe,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.</p>
