<p>God sent His Son, they called Him, Jesus;
He came to love, heal, and forgive;
He lived and died to buy my pardon,
an empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives!</p>

<p class="chorus"><strong>Chorus:</strong>
Because He lives, I can face tomorrow,
because He lives, all fear is gone;
because I kno-o-ow He holds the future,
and life is worth the living just because He lives!</p>

<p>How sweet to hold a newborn baby,
and feel the pride and joy he gives;
but greater still the calm assurance:
this child can face uncertain days because He lives!</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>

<p>And then one day, I'll cross the river,
I'll fight lifes' final war with pain;
and then, as death gives way to vict'ry,
I'll see the lights of glory and I'll know He lives!</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>
