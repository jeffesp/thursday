<p>Ain't my father or my mother but it's me, 
Oh Lord, standin' in the need of prayer.
Ain't my brother or my sister but it's me, 
Oh Lord, standin' in the need of prayer.</p>

<p>Ain't my daughter misbehavin' but it's me, 
Oh Lord, standin' in the need of prayer.
Ain't my son that's misbehavin' but it's me, 
Oh Lord, standin' in the need of prayer.</p>

<p class="chorus"><strong>Chorus:</strong>
It's me    (it's me)    it's me    
(guys)	     (gals)        (all)
Oh Lord, standin' in the need of prayer.

It's me    (it's me)    it's me    
(guys)	     (gals)        (all)
Oh Lord, standin' in the need of prayer.</p>

<p>Ain't the leader nor the teacher, but it's me,
Oh Lord, standin' in the need of prayer.
Ain't the members I've been doubtin', but it's me, 
Oh Lord, standin' in the need of prayer.</p>

<p>Ain't my work mate or my boss, but it's me 
Oh Lord, standin' in the need of prayer.  
Ain't my neighbor nor a stranger, but it's me 
Oh Lord, standin' in the need of prayer.</p>
