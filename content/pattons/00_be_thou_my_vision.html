<p>Be Thou my vision, O Lord of my heart;
Be nothing else to me, but what You are.
You're my best thought, by day or by night;
Waking or sleeping, Your presence my light.</p>

<p>Be my true Wisdom, and be my true Word;
I ever with You, and You with me Lord.
You're my great Father, and I'm Your true son;
You in me dwelling, and I with You one.</p>

<p>Riches I need not, nor man's empty praise;
You're my inheritance, now and always.
You and You only, first in my heart;
Lord King of heaven, my treasure You are.</p>

<p>Lord King of heaven, my victory won;
I can see heaven's joys, bright heaven's sun.
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall;
Still be my vision, O ruler of all.  </p>
