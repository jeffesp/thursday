<p>Gathered at the highest throne,
Welcomed by a melody,
An anthem I have always known,
A song that's always been in me--</p>
	
	<p>All glory and honor, dominion and power, to You.</p>

<p class="chorus"><strong>Chorus:</strong>
	A million angels fall, face down on the floor,
	All to echo holy is the Lord.
	My heart can't help but sing, with all of heaven roar
	Forever echo Holy is the Lord
	Oh-oh, oh-oh
	Forever echo Holy is the Lord</p>

<p>Memorized by every heart,
Written in eternity,
Every lifted voice a part,
Joining in the symphony--</p>

	<p>All glory and honor, dominion and power, to You.
	All wisdom and wonder, belong to no other, but You.</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>

<p>Standing at the end of time,
There before the throne of grace,
Majesty before my eyes,
Let it take my breath away--</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>
