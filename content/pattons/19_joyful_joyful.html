<p>Joyful, joyful, we adore You,
God of glory, Lord of love;
Hearts unfold like flow'rs before You,
Op'ning to the sun above.</p>

<p>Melt the clouds of sin and sadness;
Drive the dark of doubt away;
Giver of immortal gladness,
Fill us with the light of day!</p>

<p>All Your works with joy surround You,
Earth and heav'n reflect Your rays,
Stars and angels sing around You,
Center of unbroken praise.</p>

<p>Field and forest, vale and mountain,
Flow'ry meadow, flashing sea,
Chanting bird and flowing fountain
Call us to rejoice in Thee.</p>

<p>You are giving and forgiving, 
ever blessing, ever blest,
Well-spring of the joy of living, 
ocean-depth of happy rest!</p>

<p>God our Father, Christ our Savior, 
all who live in love are Thine;
Teach us how to love each other, 
lift us to the joy divine.  </p>
