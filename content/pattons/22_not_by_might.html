<p>Not by might, not by power, 
but by My Spirit, says the Lord-
Not by might, not by power, 
but by My Spirit, says the Lord.</p>

<p>These mountains shall be removed.  
I'll  build My temple in you-
And what I promise shall be done.
But it's not by might, not by power, 
but by My Spirit, says the Lord.</p>
