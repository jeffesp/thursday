<p>I am weak but You are strong, 
Jesus, keep me from all wrong,
I'll be satisfied as long, as I walk, 
let me walk close to Thee.</p>
 
<p class="chorus"><strong>Chorus:</strong>
Just a closer walk with Thee, grant it, Jesus, is my plea,
Daily walking close to Thee, let it be, dear Lord, let it be.</p>
 
<p>Thro' this world of toil and snares, 
if I falter, Lord, who cares?
Who with me my burden shares?  
None but Thee, dear Lord, none but Thee.</p>
 
<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>
 
<p>When my feeble life is o'er, 
time for me will be no more,
Guide me gently, safely o'er, 
to Thy Kingdom shore, to Thy shore.</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>
