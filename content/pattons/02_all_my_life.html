<p class="chorus"><strong>Chorus:</strong>
All my life I give to You, O Lord.
All my life I give to You.
I give to You as You gave to me,
All my life I give to You.</p>

<p>You led us out of darkness when we knew not where to go;
You asked us then, to follow You, and we said we would go.</p>

<p>You suffered for the sake of man, that we might live with You.
Oh, let us show our thankfulness in all we say and do.</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>
