<p>He leadeth me; O blessed thought!  
O words with heav'nly comfort fraught!
What e'er I do, where e'er I be, 
still 'tis God's hand that leadeth me.</p>

<p class="chorus"><strong>Chorus:</strong>
He leadeth me, He leadeth me, 
by His own hand He leadeth me;
His faithful follower I would be, 
for by His hand He leadeth me.  </p>

<p>Sometimes 'mid scenes of deepest gloom, 
sometimes where Eden's bowers bloom,
By waters still, o'er troubled sea, 
still 'tis His hand that leadeth me.</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>

<p>Lord, I would place my hand in thine, 
nor ever murmur nor repine;
Content, whatever lot I see, 
since 'tis my God that leadeth me.</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>
