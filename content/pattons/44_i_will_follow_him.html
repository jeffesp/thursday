<p>(slow, reverently)
I will follow Him;
Follow Him where ever He may go.
And near Him I always will be;
For nothing can keep me away--
He is my destiny.</p>

<p>I will follow Him;
Ever since He touched my heart, I knew
There isn't an ocean too deep,
A mountain so high it can keep,
Keep me away,     away from His love.</p>

<p>(faster)
I love Him!   I love Him!   I love Him!
And where He goes I'll follow!  I'll follow!  I'll follow!
 I will follow Him, follow Him where ever He may go.
There isn't an ocean too deep,
A mountain so high it can keep, keep me away.</p>

<p>We will follow Him, follow Him where ever He may go.
There isn't an ocean too deep,
A mountain so high it can keep, keep us away,       away from His love!</p>

<p>I love Him!  I love Him!   I love Him!
And where He goes I'll follow!  I'll follow!  I'll follow!
He'll always be my true love!  My true love!  My true love!
From now until forever!  Forever!  Forever!</p>

<p>There isn't an ocean too deep,
A mountain so high it can keep,
Keep us away,     away from His love!</p>
