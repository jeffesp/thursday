<p>Rock of Ages cleft for me,
Let me hide my-self in Thee.
Let the water and the blood,
From Thy wounded side that flowed, 
Be of sin the double cure,
Cleanse me from its guilt and pow'r.</p>

<p>Could my zeal no respite know,
Could my tears forever flow.
All for sin could not atone, 
Thou must save, and Thou alone.
Nothing in my hand I bring,
Simply to Thy cross I cling.</p>

<p>While I draw this fleeting breath,
When mine eyelids close in death,
When I soar to worlds unknown,
And behold Thee on Thy throne--
Rock of ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee.</p>
