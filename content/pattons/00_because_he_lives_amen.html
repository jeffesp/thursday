I believe in the Son,   I believe in the Risen One.
I believe I overcome    by the power of His blood.  
	
A-men!   A-men!   I'm a-live, I'm a-live because He lives.
A-men!   A-men!   Let my song join the one that never ends,
because He lives.

I was dead in the grave,  I was covered in sin and shame.
I heard mercy call my name.   He rolled the stone a-way.

A-men!   A-men!   I'm a-live, I'm a-live because He lives.
A-men!   A-men!   Let my song join the one that never ends,

Because He lives, I can face to-mor-row.   
Be-cause He lives, ev-'ry fear is gone.
I know   He holds   my life,   my future in His hands.  

A-men!   A-men!   I'm a-live, I'm a-live because He lives.

A-men!   A-men!   Let my song join the one that never ends.

A-men!   A-men!   I'm a-live, I'm a-live because He lives.

A-men!   A-men!    Let my song join the one that never ends,

because He lives,    because He lives.
