<p>The Lord is my Shepherd I shall not want
In green pastures He makes me lie down
He restores my soul and leads me on 
for His name, for His great name.</p>

<p class="chorus"><strong>Chorus:</strong>
Surely goodness, surely mercy
right beside me all my days 
and I will dwell in Your house forever
and bless Your Holy name.</p>

<p>You prepare a table right before me
in the presence of my enemies.
Though the arrow flies and the terror of night 
is at my door, I'll trust You Lord.</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>

<p>Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil.
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
You are on my side.
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil.
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
You are on my side.</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>
