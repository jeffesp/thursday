<p class="chorus"><strong>Chorus:</strong>
Knock, Knock, Knock, I heard Jesus knocking.
Tug, Tug, Tug, Tugging at my heart strings.
Thump, Thump, Thump, My heart started thumping,
	when I hear Him-Knocking!</p>

<p>Jesus stood outside my door asking to come in.
But He would not step inside until I asked Him in.</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>

<p>A castle is a proper place for every king to be
But Jesus Christ, the King of Kings
Chose to live in me!</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>

<p>And I was smart,
I asked Him in my heart,
when I heard Him-Knocking!
	(end.)</p>
