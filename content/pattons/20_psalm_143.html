<p>Cause me to know Your lovingkindness in the morning,
For in You do I trust.
Cause me to know the way wherein I should follow,
For I lift up my soul unto You.</p>

<p>Deliver me O Lord.
Teach me to do Your will.
Quicken me O Lord.
For I stretch forth my hands,
I stretch forth my hands,
I stretch forth my hands unto You.</p>
