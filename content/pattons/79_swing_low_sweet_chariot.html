<p class="chorus"><strong>Chorus:</strong>
Swing low, sweet chariot,
Comin' for to carry me home.
Swing low, sweet chariot,
Comin' for to carry me home.</p>

<p>I looked over Jordan and what did I see
Comin' for to carry me home
A band of angels comin' after me
Comin' for to carry me home.</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>

<p>If you get there before I do
Comin' for to carry me home.
Just tell my friends that I'm comin' too
Comin' for to carry me home.</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>
