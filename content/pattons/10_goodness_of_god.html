<p>I love you, Lord
For Your mercy never fails me.
All my days, I've been held in Your hands.
From the moment that I wake up
Until I lay my head
I will sing of the goodness of God.</p>

<p class="chorus"><strong>Chorus:</strong>
All my life You have been faithful.
All my life You have been so, so good.
With every breath that I am able
I will sing of the goodness of God.</p>

<p>I love Your voice;
You have led me through the fire.
In darkest night You are close like no other.
I've known You as a Father,
I've known You as a friend;
I have lived in the goodness of God.</p>

<p>Your goodness is running after, it's running after me.
Your goodness is running after, it's running after me.
With my life laid down, I'm surrendered now; I give You everything!
Your goodness is running after, it's running after me.</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>
