<p>Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling,
calling for you and for me.
See, on the portals He's waiting and watching,
watching for you and for me.</p>

<p class="chorus"><strong>Chorus:</strong>
Come home, come home,
ye who are weary, come home!
Earnestly, tenderly,
Jesus is calling,
calling, "O sinner, come home!"</p>

<p>Why shall we tarry when Jesus is pleading,
pleading for you and for me?
Why should we linger and head not His mercies,
mercies for you and for me? </p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>

<p>Oh! For the wonderful love He has promised,
promised for you and for me.
Though we have sinned, He has mercy and pardon,
pardon for you and for me. </p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>
