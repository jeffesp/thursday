<p>Jesus loves me, this I know, for the Bible tells me so.
Little ones to Him belong.  We are weak, but He is strong.</p>

<p class="chorus"><strong>Chorus:</strong>
Yes, Jesus loves me.  Yes, Jesus loves me.
Yes, Jesus loves me.  The Bible tells me so.  </p>

<p>Jesus loves me He who died; heaven's gates to open wide.
He will wash away my sin.  Let His little child come in.</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>

<p>Jesus loves me, this I know, though my hair is white as snow.
Though my sight is growing dim, still He bids me trust in Him.</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>

<p>Though my steps are oh, so slow, with my hand in His I'll go.
On thru life, let come what may, He'll be there to lead the way.</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>
