<p>Lord I lift your Name on high!  
How I love to sing your praises!
I'm so glad You're in my life!  
I'm so glad You came to save us!</p>

<p class="chorus"><strong>Chorus:</strong>
You came from heaven to earth
    to show the way!
From the earth to the cross
    my debt to pay!
From the cross to the grave,
from the grave to the sky,
Lord I lift your Name on high! </p>

<p>What a precious price You paid
as You suffered so to save us!
What a sacrifice You made
by Your precious blood You freed us!</p>
