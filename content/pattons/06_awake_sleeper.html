<p class="chorus"><strong>Chorus:</strong>
Awake sleeper and arise from the dead
And Christ will shine on you.
Awake sleeper and arise from the dead
And Christ will shine on you.</p>

<p>You were darkness, now you are light,
Walk as children of the light.
Fruit of light is righteous and true,
Learn to please the Lord.</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>

<p>>Therefore, life your voices in song;
Fill your hearts with thankfulness.
Always giving praise to your God;
Jesus Christ is Lord.</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>
