<p>Turn your eyes upon Jesus&dash;
Look full in His wonderful face,
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim
In the light of His glory and grace.</p>

<p>Turn your thoughts upon Jesus&dash;
Think deep of His wonderful love,
And the thoughts of sin and of self and strife
Will be lost in that rapture above.</p>
