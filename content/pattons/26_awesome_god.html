When He rolls up His sleeves He ain't just puttin' on the ritz!</p>
<p class="chorus">(together)
Our God is an awesome God!</p>
<p>(leaders)
There's thunder in His footsteps and lightning in His fists!</p>

Our God is an awesome God!</p>

And the Lord wasn't jokin' when He kicked 'em out of Eden;
It wasn't for no reason that He shed His blood;
His return is very soon and so you better be believin' that</p>

Our God is an awesome God!</p>

<p class="chorus"><strong>Chorus:</strong>
(together)
Our God is an awesome God!
He reigns from heaven above
With wisdom, power, and love
Our God is an awesome God!
(2x)</p>

<p>(leaders)
And when the sky was starless in the void of the night,</p>
<p class="chorus">(together)
Our God is an awesome God!</p>
<p>(leaders)
He spoke into the darkness and created the light!</p>
<p class="chorus">(together)
Our God is an awesome God!</p>
<p>(leaders)
Judgment and wrath He poured out on Sodom,
But mercy and grace He gave us at the cross.
I hope that we have not too quickly forgotten that</p>

Our God is an awesome God!</p>
