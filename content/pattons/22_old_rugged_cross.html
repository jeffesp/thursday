<p>On a hill far away, stood an old rugged cross-
the emblem of suffering and shame.
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
for a world of lost sinners was slain.
</p>

<p class="chorus"><strong>Chorus:</strong>
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
till my trophies at last I lay down.
I will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it someday for a crown.	
</p>

<p>O that old rugged cross, so despised by the world
has a wondrous attraction for me.
For the dear lamb of God left His glory above
to bear it on dark Calvary.
</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>
