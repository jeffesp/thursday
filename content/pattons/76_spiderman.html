<p>Spiderman, Spiderman,
does whatever a spider can:
spins a web, any size;
catches thieves, just like flies.
Look out!  Here comes the Spiderman!</p>

<p>Jesus can, Jesus can--
Better than any old spiderman!
Give you peace, make you strong.
He can show you right from wrong.
He's God!
He'll stay with you forever;
He's gonna leave you never.
Jesus, the real deal man!!!</p>
