<p>As the deer pants for the water 
so my soul longs after You.
You alone are my heart's desire 
and I long to worship You.</p>

<p class="chorus"><strong>Chorus:</strong>
You alone are my strength, my shield
To You alone will me spirit yield.
You alone are my heart's desire 
And I long to worship You.</p>

<p>You're my friend, and You are my brother
Even though you are a King.
I love You more than any other,
So much more than anything.</p>
