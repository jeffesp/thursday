<p>Lord of the starfields
Ancient of days
Universe maker
Here's a song in Your praise!</p>

<p>Wings of the storm cloud
Beginning and end
You make my heart leap
Like a banner in the wind—</p>

<p class="chorus"><strong>Chorus:</strong>
O Lo-----ve that fires the sun
Keep me burning!</p>

<p><em>(2x)</em></p>

<p>Lord of the starfields
Sower of life
Heaven and earth are
Full of Your light!</p>

<p>Voice of the nova
Smile of the dew
All of our yearning 
Only comes home to You—</p>
	
<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>
