<p class="chorus"><strong>Chorus:</strong>
Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet
and a light unto my path.  (2x)</p>

<p>When I feel afraid, think I've lost my way,
Still You're there right beside me.
Nothing will I fear, as long as You are near;
Please be near me to the end.</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>

<p>I will not forget, Your love for me, and yet
My heart forever is wandering.
Jesus, be my Guide, hold me to Your side;
And I will love You to the end.</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>

<p>You're the light unto my path.  (2x)</p>
