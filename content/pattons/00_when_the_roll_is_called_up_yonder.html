<p>When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound and time shall be no more, 
and the morning breaks eternal, bright, and fair; 
when the saved of earth shall gather over on the other shore, 
and the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there.</p>

<p class="chorus"><strong>Chorus:</strong>
When the roll    is called up yonder,
	           (echo) when the roll is called up yonder
When the roll    is called up yonder,
	           (echo) when the roll is called up yonder
When the roll    is called up yonder,
	           (echo) when the roll is called up yonder
(together)
When the roll is called up yonder I'll be there!</p>
	
<p>On that bright and cloudless morning, when the dead in Christ shall rise, 
and the glory of His resurrection share; 
when His chosen ones shall gather to their home beyond the skies, 
and the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there.</p>
