<p>These things I have spoken unto you,
that in Me you might have peace.
In the world you will have tribulation,
but be of good cheer, be of good cheer,
for I have overcome the world.  </p>

<p>If you will abide in Me
and My word abides in you,
you shall ask what you will and it shall be
given unto you, given unto you,
for I have overcome the world.  </p>
