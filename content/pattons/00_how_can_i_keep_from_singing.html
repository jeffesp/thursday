<p>My life flows on in endless song;
Above earth's lamentation,
I hear the sweet, though far-off hymn
That hails a new creation</p>
 
<p class="chorus"><strong>Chorus:</strong>
No storm can shake my inmost calm
While to that rock I'm clinging
Since Christ is Lord of heaven and earth
How can I keep from singing?</p>
 
<p>Through all the tumult and the strife,
I hear that music ringing
It finds an echo in my soul
How can I keep from singing?</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>

<p>The peace of Christ makes fresh my heart
A fountain ever springing
All things are mine since I am his
How can I keep from singing?</p>
 
<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>
