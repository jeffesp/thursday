O God, You are my God
And I will ever praise You.
I will seek You in the morning
And I will learn to walk in Your ways
And step by step You lead me
And I will follow You all of my days.</p>

<p>I will follow You all of my days.
I will follow You all of my days.
And step by step You lead me
And I will follow You all of my days.</p>
