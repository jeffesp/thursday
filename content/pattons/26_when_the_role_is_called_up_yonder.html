<p>When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound and time shall be no more, 
and the morning breaks eternal, bright, and fair; 
when the saved of earth shall gather over on the other shore, 
and the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there.</p>

<p class="chorus"><strong>Chorus:</strong>
When the roll &hellip; is called up yonder,
<span class="chorus"></span>(echo) when the roll is called up yonder
When the roll &hellip; is called up yonder,
<span class="chorus"></span>(echo) when the roll is called up yonder
When the roll &hellip; is called up yonder,
<span class="chorus"></span>(echo) when the roll is called up yonder
(together)
When the roll is called up yonder I'll be there!
</p>
	
<p>On that bright and cloudless morning, when the dead in Christ shall rise, 
and the glory of His resurrection share; 
when His chosen ones shall gather to their home beyond the skies, 
and the roll is called up yonder, Iâ€™ll be there.</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>
