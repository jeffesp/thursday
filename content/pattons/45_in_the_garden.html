<p>I come to the garden alone,
while the dew is still on the roses,
and the voice I hear falling on my ear,
the Son of God discloses.</p>

<p class="chorus"><strong>Chorus:</strong>
And He walks with me, and He talks with me,
and He tells me I am His own;
and the joy we share as we tarry there,
none other has ever known.</p>

<p>He speaks, and the sound of His voice
is so sweet the birds hush their singing,
and the melody that He gave to me
within my heart is ringing.</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>

<p>I'd stay in the garden with Him,
though the night around me be falling,
but He bids me go; thru the voice of woe,
His voice to me is calling.</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>
