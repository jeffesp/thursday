<p>Great is thy faithfulness, O God my Father,
there is no shadow of turning with Thee;
Thou changest not, Thy compassions they fail not.
As Thou has been Thou forever wilt be.</p>

<p class="chorus"><strong>Chorus:</strong>
Great is Thy faithfulness!
Great is Thy faithfulness!
Morning by morning new mercies I see.
All I have needed Thy hand hath provided
Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord unto me.</p>
 
<p>Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth,
Thy own dear presence to cheer and to guide,
strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow;
blessings all mine, with ten thousand beside.</p>
 
<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>
