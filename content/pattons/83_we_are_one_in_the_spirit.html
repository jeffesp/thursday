<p>We are one in the Spirit, we are one in the Lord.
We are one in the Spirit, we are one in the Lord.
And we pray that all unity, may one day be restored.</p>

<p class="chorus"><strong>Chorus:</strong>
	And they'll know we are Christians by our love by our love!
	Yes, they'll know we are Christians by our love!</p>

<p>We will walk with each other, we will walk hand in hand.
We will walk with each other, we will walk hand in hand.
And together we'll spread the news that God is in our land.</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>

<p>We will work with each other, we will work side by side.
We will work with each other, we will work side by side.
And we'll guard each one's dignity, together we'll abide.</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>

<p>All praise to the Father from whom all things come.
And all praise to Christ Jesus His only Son.
And all praise to the Spirit, Who makes us one.</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>
