<p>How lovely on the mountains are the feet of Him 
who brings good news, good news!
Announcing peace, proclaiming news of happiness,
Our God reigns, Our God reigns!</p>
	
<p class="chorus"><strong>Chorus:</strong>
Our God reigns! Our God reigns!   
Our God reigns, Our God reigns!</p>

<p>He had no stately form, He had no majesty
that we would be drawn to Thee.
He was despised and we took no account of Him, 
yet now He reigns, with the Most High!</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>

<p>Out of the tomb He came with grace and majesty,
He is alive, He is alive!
God loves us so, see here His hands, His feet, His side.  
Yes we know, He is alive!</p>
 
<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>
