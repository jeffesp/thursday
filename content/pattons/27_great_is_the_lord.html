<p>Great is the Lord, He is holy and just;
By His power we trust in His love.</p>

<p>Great is the Lord, He is faithful and true;
By His mercies He proves He is love.</p>

<p>Great is the Lord and worthy of glory;
Great is the Lord and worthy of praise.</p>

<p>Great are You Lord, we life up our voice,
We life up our voice:  Great is the Lord!
Great is the Lord!</p>
