<p>I'm finding myself at a loss for words
And the funny things is it's okay
The last thing I need is to be heard
But to hear what You would say</p>
	
<p class="chorus"><strong>Chorus:</strong>
	Oh Word of God speak
	Would You pour down like rain
	Washing my eyes to see Your majesty
	To be still and know
	That You're in this place
	Please let me stay and rest in Your holiness
	Word of God speak</p>

<p>I'm finding myself in the midst of You
Beyond the music, beyond the noise
All that I need is to be with You 
And in the quiet hear Your voice</p>

<p class="chorus">
Oh Word of God speak
Would You pour down like rain
Washing my eyes to see Your majesty
To be still and know
That You're in this place
Please let me stay and rest in Your holiness</p>


<p class="chorus">
Oh Word of God speak
Would You pour down like rain
Washing my eyes to see Your majesty
To be still and know
That You're in this place
Please let me stay and rest ...in Your holiness...</p>
