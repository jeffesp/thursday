<p>The splendor of a King, clothed in majesty;
let all the Earth rejoice, all the Earth rejoice.
He wraps himself in light, and darkness tries to hide;
it trembles at His voice, trembles at His voice!</p>

<p class="chorus"><strong>Chorus:</strong>
How great is our God! 
Sing with me:  How great is our God! 
and all will see how great, how great is our God!</p>

<p>And age to age He stands, and time is in His hands;
    beginning and the end; beginning and the end.
The Godhead Three in One:  Father, Spirit, and Son;
The Lion and the Lamb, the Lion and the Lamb!</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>

<p>Name above all names!   Worthy of all praise!
My heart will sing:  How great is our God! </p>
<p>Name above all names!   Worthy of all praise!
And my heart will sing:  How great is our God!</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>
