<p>There's more that rises in the morning than the sun
More that shines in the night than just the moon
There's more than just this fire here that keeps me warm
In a shelter that is larger than this room</p>

<p>There's a loyalty that's deeper than mere sentiment
And a music higher than the songs that I can sing
The stuff of earth competes for the allegiance
I owe only to the giver of all good things</p>

<p class="chorus"><strong>Chorus:</strong>
So if I stand let me stand on the promise that You will pull me through
And if I can't let me fall on the grace that first brought me to You
If I sing let me sing for the joy that has born in me these so---ongs
But if I weep let it be as a man who is longing for his home</p>

<p>There's more that dances on the prairies than the wind
More that pulses in the ocean than the tide
There's a love that's fiercer than a love between friends
More gently than a mother's when her baby's at her side</p>

<p>And there's a loyalty that's deeper than mere sentiment
A music higher than the songs that I can sing
The stuff of earth competes for the allegiance
I owe only to the giver of all good things</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>
