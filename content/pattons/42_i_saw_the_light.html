<p>I wandered so aimless, life filled with sin.
I wouldn't let my dear Savior in.
Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night.
Praise the Lord, I saw the light!</p>

<p class="chorus"><strong>Chorus:</strong>
I saw the light, I saw the light.
No more darkness, no more night.  
Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight.
Praise the Lord, I saw the light!</p>

<p>Just like a blind man, I wandered along.
Worries and fears I claimed for my own.
Then like the blind man that God gave back his sight,
Praise the Lord, I saw the light.</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>

<p>I was a fool to wander and stray.
For straight is the gate and narrow the way.
Now I have traded the wrong for the right.
Praise the Lord, I saw the light.</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>
