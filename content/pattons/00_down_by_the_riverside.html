<p>Gonna lay down my sword and shield, down by the riverside,
	Down by the riverside, down by the riverside.
Gonna lay down my sword and shield, down by the riverside,
	And study-y war no more.</p>

<p class="chorus"><strong>Chorus (2x):</strong>
I ain't gonna study war no more, 
I ain't gonna study war no more,
	I ain't gonna study-y war no more.  </p>

<p>I'm gonna join hands with everyone, down by the riverside,
Down by the riverside, down by the riverside.
I'm gonna join hands with everyone, down by the riverside,
	And study-y war no more.</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>

<p>I'm gonna walk with the Prince of Peace, down by the riverside,
Down by the riverside, down by the riverside.
I'm gonna walk with the Prince of Peace, down by the riverside,
	And study-y war no more.</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>
