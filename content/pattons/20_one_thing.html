<p>One thing I have desired of the Lord	
And that will I seek after:		
That I may dwell in His house all the days of my life	
And behold the beauty of the Lord.</p>

<p>In times of trouble He will hide me there
Safe in the secret of His temple.
He will set me on a rock
So my head will be higher
Than the heads of my enemies around me.</p>

<p>Therefore, I will offer up my sacrifice of joy
To the Lord in His temple.
Therefore will I sing, I will sing
Songs of praise unto the Lord.</p>
