<p>Seek ye first the kingdom of God
And His righteousness
And all these things shall be added unto you.
Allelu, alleluia</p>

<p>Man does not live by bread alone
But by every word
That proceeds from the mouth of God.
Allelu, alleluia</p>

<p>Ask and it shall be given unto you
Seek and ye shall find
Knock and the door shall be opened unto you.
Allelu, alleluia</p>
