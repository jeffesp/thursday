<p>I believe in faithfulness.  
I believe in giving of myself for someone else.  
I believe in peace and love.  
I believe in honesty and trust, but it's not enough.  
For all that I believe may never change the way it is 
unless I believe Jesus lives.  </p>

<p class="chorus"><strong>Chorus:</strong>
Where there is faith, there is a voice calling:  
"Keep walking.  You're not alone in this world."
Where there is faith, there is a peace like a child sleeping.
Hope everlasting in He who is able to bear
Every burden, to heal every hurt in my heart.  
It is a wonderful, powerful place, where there is faith.</p>

<p>There's a man across the sea, 
never heard the sound of freedom ring, only in his dreams.
There's a lady dressed in black, 
in a motorcade of Cadillacs.  Daddy's not coming back.  
And our hearts begin to fall and our stability grows weak, 
but Jesus meets our needs if we only believe.</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>
