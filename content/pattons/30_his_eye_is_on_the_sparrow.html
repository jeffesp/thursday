<p>Why should I feel discouraged,
Why should the shadows come,
Why should my heart be lonely,
And long for heav'n and home,
When Jesus is my portion, A constant Friend is He;
His eye is on the sparrow,
And I know He watches me.
His eye is on the sparrow,
And I know He watches me.</p>
 
<p class="chorus"><strong>Chorus: 2x</strong>
I sing because I'm happy,
I sing because I'm free;
For His eye is on the sparrow,
And I know He watches me.
For His eye is on the sparrow,
And I know He watches me.</p>

<p>His eye is on the sparrow,
And I know He watches me.</p>
