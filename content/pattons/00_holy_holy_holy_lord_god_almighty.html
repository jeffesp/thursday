<p>Holy, holy, holy!  Lord God Almighty!
Early in the morning our song shall rise to Thee.
Holy, holy, holy!  Merciful and mighty!
God in three Persons, blessed Trinity!</p>

<p>Holy, holy, holy!  All the saints adore Thee,
Casting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea;
Cherubim and seraphim falling down before Thee,
Who was, and is, and evermore shall be.</p>

<p>Holy, holy, Holy tho' the darkness hide Thee,
Tho' the eye of sinful man Your glory may not see;
Only You are holyâ€”there is none beside Thee,
Perfect in pow'r, in love, and purity.</p>

<p>Holy, holy, holy!  Lord God Almighty!
All Your works shall praise Your name in earth, and sky, and sea.
Holy, holy, holy!  Merciful and mighty!
God in three Persons, blessed Trinity!</p>
