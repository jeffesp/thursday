<p>When I go, don't cry for me
In my Father's arms I'll be
The wounds this world left on my soul
Will all be healed and I'll be whole.
</p>
<p>Sun and moon will be replaced
With the light of Jesus' face
And I will not be ashamed
For my Savior knows my name.
</p>

<p><strong>Chorus:</strong>
It don't matter where you bury me,
I'll be home and I'll be free.
It don't matter where I lay,
All my tears be washed away.
</p>

<p>Gold and silver blind the eye
Temporary riches lie
Come and eat from heaven's store,
Come and drink, and thirst no more
</p>

<p>So, weep not for me my friend,
When my time below does end
For my life belongs to Him.
Who will raise the dead again.
</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus x2)</em></p>
