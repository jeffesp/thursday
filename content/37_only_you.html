<p>No one but You, Lord
Can satisfy the longing in my heart
Nothing I do, Lord
Can take the place of drawing near to You</p>

<p><strong>Chorus:</strong>
Only You can fill my deepest longing
Only You can breathe in me new life
Only You can fill my heart with laughter
Only You can answer my heart's cry </p>

<p>Father, I love You
Come satisfy the longing in my heart
Fill me, overwhelm me
Until Your love burns deep within my heart
<em>(repeat Choros)</em> </p>
