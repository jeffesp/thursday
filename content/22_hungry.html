<p>Hungry, I come to You
For I know You satisfy
I am empty, but I know
Your love does not run dry.
And so I wait for You,
So I wait for You.  </p>

<p><strong>Chorus:</strong>
I'm falling on my knees,
Offering all of me.
Jesus, You're all this heart is living for.</p>

<p>Broken, I run to You,
For Your anns are open wide;
I am weary, but I know
Your touch restores my life.
And so I wait for You.
So I wait for You,
<em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>
