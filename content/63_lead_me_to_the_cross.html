<p>Savior I come
Quiet my soul
Remember
Redemption's hill
Where your blood was spilled
For my ransom
</p>

<p>Everything I once held dear
I count it all as lost
</p>

<p><strong>Chorus:</strong>
Lead me to the cross
Where your love poured out
Bring me to my knees
Lord, I lay me down
Rid me of myself,
I belong to You
Lead me, lead me to the cross</p>

<p>You were as I
Tempted and trialed
You are
The Word became flesh
Bore my sin and death
Now You're risen
</p>

<p>Everything I once held dear
I count it all as lost
</p>

<p><em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>

<p><strong>Bridge:</strong>
To your heart
To your heart
Lead me to your heart
Lead me to your heart</p>
