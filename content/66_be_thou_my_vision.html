<p>Be Thou my vision, Oh Lord of my heart.
Be nothing else to me but what you are.
You're my best thought by day or by night.
Waking or sleeping, your presence, my light.</p>

<p>Be thou my wisdom and be my true Word.
I ever with you, and you with me, Lord.
You're my great Father, I'm your true son.
You in me dwelling, and I with you one.</p>

<p>Riches I need not, nor man's empty praise.
You're my inheritance now and always.
You and you only are first in my heart.
Lord, King of heaven,my treasure you are.</p>

<p>Be Thou my shield and my sword for the fight
Be Thou my dignity, be Thou my might
You're my soul's shelter and You're my high tower
Lord, raise me heavenward, O Power of my power</p>

<p>Lord, King of heaven, my victory won.
I shall see heaven's joys, bright heaven's sun.
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall.
Always my vision, O Ruler of all.</p>
