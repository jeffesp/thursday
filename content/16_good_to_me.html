<p>I cry out
For Your hand of mercy to heal me
I am weak
And I need Your love to free me
Oh Lord, My rock
My strength in weakness,
Come rescue me, oh Lord
You are my hope,
Your promise never fails me
And my desire
Is to follow You forever
For You are good, ForYou are good
For You are good to me
For You are good, For You are good
For You are good to me</p>
