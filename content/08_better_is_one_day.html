<p>How lovely is Your dwelling place,
Oh Lord Almighty
My soul longs and even faints for You
For here my heart is satisfied,
Within Your presence
I sing beneath the shadow of Your wings</p>

<p><strong>Chorus:</strong>
Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere</p>

<p>One thing I ask and I would seek,
To see Your beauty
To find You in the place Your glory dwells
<em>(repeat Chorus)</em></p>

<p>My heart and flesh cry out,
For You the living God
Your spirit's water for my soul
I've tasted and I've seen,
Come once again to me
I will draw near to You
I will draw near to You</p>
